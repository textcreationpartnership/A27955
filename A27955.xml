            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO prefix your Name to a piece of ſo little worth, may argue ſomewhat of preſumption; but to be intirely wanting in thoſe reſpects, ſo much your due, is a more conſiderable fault.</p>
            <p>It was not without relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance, that I conſented to put this little Treatiſe under your ſafe-guard: Not that I
<pb facs="tcp:51104:3"/> queſtion'd the influence of your Name; but leaſt the ſlender value of the thing ſhould lead a contempt from you to the Author.</p>
            <p>But then I conſider'd, that although you would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover the meanneſs of this attempt, yet you were endued with a ſufficient ſhare of goodneſs, not to miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the honeſt end; The firſt oppoſed my growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to make you the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron hereof: the laſt adviſed me to go on, as being incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with cenſure, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>You are ingaged, Sir, in an eſpecial manner to the
<pb facs="tcp:51104:3"/> Office of pardoning, as well upon the account of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from our inferiour Orb, as in regard to the fair endowments of your mind: both implying good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in a conſpicuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>As to my Author, I durſt venture to aſſert, that he has manag'd himſelf like a man of Honeſty and Parts, that his arguments are as material and perſuaſive as the Subject will bear, and if any thing renders him of leſs value, 'tis the ill performance of the Tranſlation, which, I believe, is made worſe by the miſtakes of the Printer.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:51104:4"/>
            <p>I can eaſily foreſee, that it will be condemned by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious part of the world, but ſince the wiſer men muſt infallibly commend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; I am little concerned at what the Fop ſhall declare againſt it.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> Deſign not, Reader, to tell you all the advantages of this Book. You will ſufficiently diſcover them, when you read it. I hope you will not find it altogether unworthy of your eſteem, if you judge of it without prejudice. You will learn in it the art of fearing God, and to be an honeſt Man; to avoid the irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of a licentious life, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the vertues of a Chriſtian life. This is its general aim. And what follows its particular. It endeavours to inſpire you with the love of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. It makes appear that there is nothing in the World more excellent, or more neceſſary, than this holy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It opens to you an eaſie way to enter it advantagiouſly. It fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes you with means to make it
<pb facs="tcp:51104:6"/> an eternal Spring of lawful pleaſures, and to partake of them with ſo much the more ſatisfaction, as they are pure and innocent. In a word it affords you precepts to ſpeak well and to make a true judgment of Ladies; that is to ſay, what you naturally love the moſt, and whom ever the Laws of civility oblige you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>

            <p>In effect, it is certain that tho' a Maid never asks to Marry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe has modeſty, yet there is nothing ſhe deſires with greater paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

It muſt be confeſs'd likewiſe that it is her true ſtate, and that there is no better party for her to take. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Woman makes a ſad Figure in the world. She wants the ſhadow of a Husband to protect her from Miſery, Seduction, or Calumny. I have two things more to let you know.

            <p>THERE never was a bolder under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, than that of this Book. Its deſign is to eſtabliſh an opinion, which all Men oppoſe, and to diſengage them from an Error which is almoſt as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the World. We ſay every day a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand injurious things of Marriage. One would have it to be the Sepulchre of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. Another looks upon it as a ſevere Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Even thoſe, who ſpeak of it with moſt moderation, ceaſe not to term it a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Evil. Behold the error I deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. On the otherſide that Marriage is an excellent thing, a happy condition, and a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety full of ſweetneſs, is what exceeds belief. It is even ridiculed: and it is notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>As little equity as one may have, can one obſerve (without paſſion) ſuch vilifying of that fair half of Human-kind, to whom it ſeems as if Nature had given all her Graces in poſſeſſion?

What would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the World without Marriage? What would become of all Human-kind? 'Tis certain that it would ſoon be at an end, and with it all our Intereſts. This conſideration animates my Courage, and makes me even hope, that in ſpight of the infatuation of Men, and their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Criticks againſt Marriage; God will enable me to ſupport its ſacred rights, and to convince them that in the bottom, this of all conditions of life is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to them.</p>
            <p>As to what remains, I cannot make the Apology of Marriage without making that of this lovely Sex, for whom all ſenſible men ought to have a veneration, ſince by relation to Marriage it ſelf, it is the ſoundeſt and moſt conſiderable part.

In the fourth anſwer the objections they make, and the falſe reaſons they alledge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unmarried. And finally, in the

Behold Subjects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to compoſe a large Volume, if a Man would exhauſt the matter of them, and treat of them in all their extent: but as I love little Books, and am naturally disheartned with thoſe that are not ſo; I ſhall only inſiſt upon things neceſſary and eſſential to my deſign, as much as I am able, to the end that it may not hold you long, and you may ſoon diſcover the ſcope of it.</p>

                  </gap> way of Proverb, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud in titulo, aliud in pixide,</hi> may very well be applied to Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. One obſerves one thing in it, but one finds another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly different. It is remarked of the Temples of ancient <hi>Egypt,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more magnificent without, nor more barbarous within. On the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51104:14"/> other ſide we read of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that under a mean co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of <hi>Goats</hi>-Skins, it contained the Ark of Alliance, the Mercy-Seat, the Altar of Gold, and a thouſand other precious things. This Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and not the other, is a very plain repreſentation of Marriage. If you conſider the outſide of it, what can be more miſerable in appearance? One ſees nothing but difficulties. One muſt pleaſe a Wife. One muſt bring up Children. One muſt be mindful of a Family. One muſt paſs through a thouſand kinds of proofs. But if you examine its inward part, what ſweetneſs, what ſatisfaction, what delight ſhall you not diſcover for Man, ſince God reſides therein, and pours out the influence of his grace upon it? Nothing in nature can repreſent to us the felicity of a Marriage bleſt of Heaven, and poſſeſſed of the peace of the Holy-Spirit.</p>
               <p>I confeſs likewiſe that Marriage, as well all other humane conditions, is a compoſition of Good and Evil, of Sweets and Bitters, of Joy and Sorrow: it is not exempt from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces.

               <p>IF I was only to treat with Saints upon this Subject, I ſhould not have occaſion to uſe many words in order to perſuade them, that nothing is more infamous than Incontinence.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51104:40"/> which they profeſs. But, Sir, it is with Sinners and great ones too, that I muſt have to do. Even with ſuch, who for the moſt part are grown old in criminal habits, and who make a ſport of that filthy debauchery, for which Heaven declares ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
               <p>You apprehend that if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of the charms of Marriage, they are no leſs of the horrors of Luſt, and that it is equally difficult to convince them of the excellency of the one, and the infamy of the other. They are a ſort of people willful in their blindneſs. They reſolve to ſee nothing in the firſt but what is irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, in order to make it an object of Contempt. They refuſe to ſee any thing in the ſecond but what's agreeable, in order to make that a continual object of Concupiſence.</p>
               <p>This diſorder is even ſo common, ſo general, and ſo well fixed in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that to undertake to withdraw men from it, and to exhort them to return from an errour, which it is much more eaſie to blame than avoid, is in ſome ſort to make himſelf ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous;

               <p>Thoſe of the ſecond Order, are, I confeſs, ſo much the more criminal, as they know their Duty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it not; as they ſin againſt the light of their proper Conſcience, and as they are acquainted with the Law of God, which is, that they who do theſe things are worthy of death: But they are the firſt in condemning their own conduct.

               <p>We ſhall obſerve in the ſequel a little more particularly the vanity of all theſe illuſions, and the enormity of the crime of all theſe kinds of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines. But, before we leave them, be pleaſed to remark, Sir, that this filthy debauchery, which is the ſubject thereof, is a many-headed Monſter, and a ſpring which divides it ſelf into ſeveral rivolets. To ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the men of the world acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other incontinence, than that of the Body, which is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the union of Sexes. But the Goſpel whoſe morality is infinitely more holy than that of men, eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es four others beſides that, which it likewiſe affirms to be very criminal, to wit, that of the heart, that of the eyes, that of the mouth, and that of the hand.</p>
               <p>The incontinence of the heart is nothing elſe but the Concupiſence of Women, and a violent deſire of being joyned with them, through the ſole principle of a ſenſual pleaſure.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51104:50"/> Naturally we find a ſatisfaction in the thoughts of a handſome Woman, and we revolve agreeably in our minds the remembrance of what we have ſeen aimable in them. When that blind Boy, whom Paganiſm yet more blind has made a God, has once pierc d the heart with one of his in venom d Arrows, he produces there immediately all the motions of his immodeſt mother. Then it is, Man becomes Frantick, and void of ſenſe. All his conduct is but a pure extravagance. He is no more himſelf, but the object's that inflames him. It is a ſhadow that purſues him every where. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual thought day and night. His watchings and his dreams are full of it, his imagination repreſents to him continually the Image of her whom he adores.

She ſinn'd. One may ſay that a fine Woman is this prohibited fruit. But where is he that is not pleas'd to look upon it? The beſt of men cannot refrain. They do it oftentimes without any deſign to offend God. They propoſe nothing to themſelves, if you will, but to admire the excellency of the Workman in conſidering ſo curious a work. But the Devil more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than they, makes uſe of this ſight to kindle in their hearts the fire of concupiſence.</p>

               <p>Alas there are but few now a days like <hi>Job,</hi> who made a contract with his eyes not to look upon a Virgin. One ſees every where laſcivious eyes. The Publick walks ſerve only to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their immodeſty. They reſpect not even the Altars of the Lord, and the Aſſemblies of his People. If a man diſcovers a Lady there of a well made, agreeable aſpect, he willingly prefers the pleaſure of obſerving her, to that of diſcharging the duties of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. There needs no more to freeze the hotteſt devotion. <hi>Homo ex humo ſine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitate non eſt homo.</hi> Man is made out of the earth, nor is a man without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>

This is certainly a ſpecies of fornication, as well by the pleaſure
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51104:52"/> that is taken in uttering theſe obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as becauſe they are the inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of concupiſence, and contribute much to the corrupting of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. One may even be aſſured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of a miſtake, that thoſe who are pleaſed with ſuch kind of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are already very much corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their hearts. In effect, the mouth ſpeaks only from the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart, as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. One is the interpreter of the other. The mouth ſpeaks ill, becauſe the heart thinks ill. The effect pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the nature of its cauſe: and ſuch as the principle is, ſuch alſo is the act. <hi>Ream linguam non facit, niſi mens rea.</hi> We may even affirm; that theſe laſcivious tongues are almoſt an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proof of a licentious life; for as St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>Verba ſunt ſigna eorum,</hi> Words are the images or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of things. The words of men very often give us to underſtand what they are.</p>
               <p>There is very little appearance that a man will not act as he loves to talk, and that being immodeſt in his converſation he ſhould not be ſo in his conduct.</p>

What was more carefully and earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us by the Apoſtles, than a purity and ſanctity in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation?</p>
               <p>In fine, what ſhall I ſay of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the hand with relation to this miſerable ſin of wantonneſs. O God, what abominations! what obſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities!
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51104:53"/> what unlawful uſes! what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous things, which one durſt not either think or relate, doth it not commit? This crime, which modeſty will not ſuffer to be named, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as it is, is ne'er the leſs enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. It was long ſince ſtruck with the curſe of Heaven in the perſon of <hi>Onan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 38.9.</note> Son of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereof the Scripture tells us.</p>
               <p>Is it a wonder after all this, that God ſhould have ſo much horror for this crime? Is it any ſurpriſe that he ſhould thunder againſt it ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful menaces? It is matter of conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that he ſhould join to it an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riditary curſe upon families? In a word, that he ſhould ſo often bring upon the people and upon private perſons ſuch terrible marks of his diſpleaſure? It muſt be granted that nothing is more frequent in Holy Scripture, than prohibitions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Sin, and the examples of its puniſhment. It is not in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue alone, that God ſays, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery. He ſpeaks it in a thouſand other places of his
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51104:54"/> word. The New Teſtament eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally recommends to us nothing elſe. The Sermons of our Saviour, and the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles are filled therewith. Their principal end is to diſpoſe us to a purity of body and mind: and they proteſt that nothing is more diſpleaſing to God, than the polluted Garment of the fleſh. It is not <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomarrha</hi> alone that has drawn down the fire of Heaven. Alas! a thouſand other Cities, and an infinite number of other ſinners have been conſumed in all Ages and all Nations upon account of this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Luſt. But admit there was nothing elſe except the puniſhments of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, and that hideous Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, to which in the Theology of Jeſus Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles it neceſſarily leads men, needs there any more to convince us, that nothing is more pernicious, and ought to be more ſoveraignly hated by us?</p>
               <p>Is it not ſtrange, perhaps you'll ſay, that God who knows Man ſo well, ſhould with ſo much exactneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a thing, which is ſo natural to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51104:54"/> him, and that he ſhould condemn him to the puniſhments of Hell for a Sin, which it is almoſt impoſſible for him not to commit in one of thoſe kinds you have treated of? doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, That the fleſh is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither can it be.<note place="margin">

               <p>I reply, Sir, that this great propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity it ſelf, which Man naturally has for this debauchery is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reaſons, that have oblig'd the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to joyn ſo much puniſhment to it, and to thunder ſo many Curſes upon it. If inſpite of his prohibition and all his threatnings, Man is inſolent enough to abandon himſelf to it as much as he doth, judge to what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs he hath puſhed on the crime, and what he had been able to attempt without it.</p>

There is no method more ſecure than that, in order to put of entirely the bondage of the paſſions; or to ſay better, it is the only one whoſe ſucceſs is infallible to that end. When a man is truly converted, he has a holy diſlike of himſelf. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts his precedent converſation. He has a horrour for his crime. He finds no further pleaſure, but in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his God. He has a diſguſt for all the vain delights of the fleſh. <hi>David, Magdelain,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are great and admirable examples hereof. I reply to you in the ſecond place, Marry. In effect, although there is no condition happy enough to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly exempt from all the blots of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence, and that a thouſand mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51104:64"/> after this the efficacy of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to deliver us from this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious malady? ſhould we not believe an Apoſtle, who brought all he has ſaid to us from the third Heaven, and who has given us nothing but what he received from the Lord himſelf? who could judge better than he, of our neceſſities? I am ſurpriſed that after ſo expreſs an Order to Marry, and ſo authentick a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the neceſſity of Marriage in reference to Salvation, there ſhould be a ſingle man in the world, that can have it in contempt.</p>
               <p>This is ſo much the more ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, as this Order is as ancient as the World. It is not from St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is from God himſelf. As ſoon as he had formed Man, he gave him a Wife. He married him. And he commanded all his deſcendents to marry. Jeſus Chriſt has renewed the precept under the Goſpel. I don't pretend, Sir, that this command is abſolute and obligatory for all men, as ſome have been of opinion. A man doth not abſolutely diſobey God in remaining a Batchelour, provided
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51104:65"/> that he lives piouſly in that ſtate How many perſons are there, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this, for I know not what difficulties they frame to themſelves; whereof one part is purely imaginary, another is tyed to all the conditions of life, and the reſt is nothing in compariſon of the real pleaſures of Marriage.

                  </gap>its! whatſoever they may aſſert, as the multiplication of Men is the undoubted end of Marriage, it is certain that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is the only means it has ordained, and whereof it will make uſe to that end. In its pure maxims all other ways of peopling the world are unlawful and prohibited. 'Tis what ſhe has even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the hearts of all honeſt men. Thoſe States, that acted only by their Principles, and to whom the orders of God were unknown, have not ceaſed to recommend Marriage as the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of Societies: and to forbid Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence as the ſhame of humanity. I have already made it appear, there needs no more upon this head.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:51104:72"/>
               <p>But, Sir, if we would be intirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that Fornication, Polygamy, and Concubine-keeping are no lawful ways of multiplying men, and that nothing more diſpleaſes Heaven, conſider the Countries where theſe kinds of Liberties are permitted. Do you imagine that the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the <hi>Pagans,</hi> who live in all theſe diſorders, encreaſe their Species more than the Chriſtians, who abhor them? It is certain that they are even leſs fertile. Did you never make reflection upon the Sheep and the Wolves? The firſt produce but once a year, and only one Lamb at each time. Notwithſtanding altho' an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them is eaten every day, the earth is covered with them. The laſt on the other ſide generate many times a year, and bring forth no leſs than ſix or ſeven little ones. Beſides being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the nouriſhment of men, their number is not leſſened for this uſe. And yet we know that there are but few of them ſeen in compariſon of Sheep. Who makes a doubt that there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Providence therein? It is exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame with all thoſe prohibited U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, whereof I have treated, and with lawful Marriage. Who would not ſay
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51104:72"/> that <hi>Turkey, Perſia, Japan,</hi> and all thoſe other Countrys where it is permitted to have ſeveral Wives, and various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, muſt be infinitely populous? and yet they are leſs numerous than Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Altho' the Bed of Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts but of two perſons, it doth not ceaſe to be much more fertile, than that of all theſe Infidels, as manifold as it is. There is no appearance of reaſon in refering this to the ſingle climate and particular conſtitution of Men. There is without diſpute ſomewhat of myſtery therein. God and nature were pleaſed to let us know by the ſame, that the union of one man with one ſingle woman is the real method one muſt purſue for the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of mankind Do we not know likewiſe that almoſt all thoſe Whores and debauch'd Women, who are the ſcandal of their Sex, are barren, and that the greateſt part of them need not make uſe of a thouſand ſorts of criminal ways to become ſo, as they do every day? It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains then to conclude that nothing but Marriage can really and lawfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this firſt end of Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of indiſpenſible obligation to Men.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:51104:73"/>
               <p>The quality of Citizens of the world, and members of the State, is a reaſon of no leſs force to diſpoſe them to it. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays that Man is an Animal natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally politick. This is very true. Scarce were Men upon the Earth but they thought how to erect themſelves into a Body, into a Common-wealth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Kingdom. The moſt barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have voluntarily ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either to a Monarchy, or to an Ariſtocracy, or elſe to a Democracy. Monarchy without doubt is the beſt of the three, becauſe it comes neareſt to the Divinity. But they are all lawful and permitted of God; add, Sir, that they are all likewiſe very neceſſary.</p>

               <p>This conſideration has been a motive to ſeveral People of the World not only to ſpeak of Marriage with praiſe, but alſo to reward its fertillity with magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.

The heavenly voice ſeems to call you to it. Reſiſt no longer its Vocation. But to the end that you may know all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements you are under to pay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, make ſome reflections, if you pleaſe, upon the quality of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which you have taken into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Church.</p>
               <p>This, Sir, is the greateſt motive, which ought to determine you for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. It even recollects in it ſelf all the reſt. What do you take the Church to be?

               <p>The divine Family, whereof God is the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the eldeſt Son, and the Elect the younger ones, if one may be allowed to ſpeak ſo. Tell me, I beſeech you, if in all theſe regards, there is any thing more precious in the world, than the Church? Tell me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if there is any thing, to whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence men are more obliged to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute? What are all our Intereſts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that? If you ask me the true reaſon, that ought to make us deſire the propagation of Mankind, the duration of States, and the Conſervation of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: It is nothing elſe but the Subſiſtence of the Church, which is infinitely more excellent than the World, and all its So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. This ought to be the chiefeſt end of all our Vows, and all our Cares.</p>
               <p>How ought a Chriſtian, do you think, to endeavour the advancement of this Myſtical Empire of Jeſus Chriſt, the exaltation of his Reign; the Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of his Church? He may, Sir, acquit himſelf of this Duty in a double manner; both by Paſſion and by Action: Firſt, he muſt ſuffer, he muſt mortify
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51104:80"/> himſelf. In the Second place, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he labour, and put himſelf in action for her. Now of all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may contribute to this end, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is without doubt the principal: Since it is the natural and material cauſe of the faithful, without which all moral cauſes would be abſolutely uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> built his Tabernacle, the Men and Women contributed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and with great Zeal, all that was neceſſary for its conſtruction. What ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal would it be for Chriſtians not to do for the Truth, what the <hi>Jews</hi> did for the Figure? Thoſe people diſpoſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with pleaſure of the moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things they had, in order to enrich that ancient Tent of the Deſart. What ſhould not we perform then for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Divine Tabernacle, which God has planted, and not Man? But Sir, the queſtion here is neither of Gold, nor Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, precious Stones. or fine Linnen, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or Scarlet. The Tabernacle of the Church is not compoſed of dead and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible things. Brutal and Inanimate Stones enter not into its conſtruction. There muſt be living ones for that end.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51104:80"/> There muſt be faithful Men. There muſt be reaſonable creatures. There muſt be Chriſtians ſanctified by the aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the blood of Chriſt. How glorious is it for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother to contribute a great number of theſe living Stones for the Edification and Conſervation of the Church? Marriage is the only quarry,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1, 2.16.</note> from whence they muſt be had. God allows of no other. Indeed they are not in a condition proper to build this holy ſtructure. <hi>My Mother conceived me in ſin, and brought me forth in iniquity,</hi> ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi> If we refer our ſelves even to the Satyrick Poet, he will likewiſe inſtruct us in what the Scripture every where tells us, <hi>that all Men are born with Sin.</hi>

               <p>But here Grace is added to Nature. Marriage makes Men: And of theſe men God makes his Elect. Inſomuch that it is ever true to ſay in a certain ſenſe, that Marriage makes the Elect, which are members of the Church; ſince it is the Organon of Nature to bring them into the world, and that Grace whfch rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51104:81"/> them, acts upon them only as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on works of this very Nature. In this proſpect it is ſcarce poſſible to expreſs the excellency of Marriage, and what ſtrong engagements men are under to marry.</p>
               <p>Philoſophers ſay, that a Being may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelf two ways, by Subſtraction, and by privation of means; either in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things contrary to its Subſiſtence, or in omitting thoſe things which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to it. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſtroyed the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the firſt manner: And thoſe who live unmarried now a days, deſtroy the Chriſtian Church in the ſecond. That barbarous King by cauſing all the Male Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be thrown into the <hi>Nile,</hi> rendred their propagation fruitleſs; and thoſe who remain in the ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle men, as far as they can, make it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. So that the Church is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them for its ſubſiſtence. This Doctrine is even conformable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scriptute, which ſays, that he who doth not prevent a mans death by furniſhing him with means to live, kills him. If this Theology be true, as we muſt not queſtion it, I can hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51104:81"/> how all thoſe obſtinate and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Batchelors ſhould not be amazed thereat. What greater misfortune could arrive to them, than not only to have performed nothing for the Glory and Advantage of this undefiled Spouſe of our Saviour, which coſt him his life; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to have laboured for its deſtruction by not doing what is capable to preſerve it? Where is the State, where is the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where is the Society, more worthy to ſubſiſt than the Church? All the reſt is ſupported only for her ſake. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna eſt Orbis Eccleſia,</hi> The World, this unhappy World, which ſo outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly perſecutes her, would be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without this daughter of Heaven. It is preſerved only to give place to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Elect. So ſoon as they are all in the Eſſence of things, adieu to the world. Heavens! What afflictions ſhould not thoſe old Batchelors undergo for not having contributed to its conformation?</p>
               <p>But Sir, one of thoſe things which ought, methinks, to be moſt prevailing with you for Marriage, is, that you will infallibly marry at one time or other. Sooner or later you will be inclined to it.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51104:82"/> It is with Marriage, as with new faſhions. At firſt they appear inſupportable? But by little and little the eyes are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them, and at length one ſubmits to them with others. How many men likewiſe do we obſerve, who after having long declamed againſt Marriage, fail not to confine themſelves under its laws? Are you ignorant that thoſe who ſpeak of it, as of a ſolly, ſay that it muſt be done once in a mans life? That Poet ſo know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Art of Love, whom I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited ſo often, tells us with a grace that <hi>Venus</hi> never loſes her rights, and that all men are tributary to her.</p>

               <p>It is certain that Marriage is of extream ſervice to retain a man in his Duty, and that it makes him avoid a thouſand oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to remove himſelf from it, which are very ordinary with Batchelors. As I have ſaid, we naturally love the Society of Women. So that if a man has not one of his own, he without difficulty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelf to go and ſeek out others abroad. He ſees them, he courts them, he endeavours to get himſelf beloved by them, and oftentimes he ſucceeds but with too much eaſineſs. The handſomer they are, the greater is the danger for both. Our Eccleſiaſtical Author ſays, that many have been ſeduced by the Beauty of the wife. From whence come all thoſe Domeſtick Diſorders which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of ſo many Husbands and Fathers unhappy; and which is owing to the wantonneſs of theſe wicked Batchelors, who by frequent Viſits and criminal inventions, have found out a means to corrupt the vertue of their Wives and Daughters?</p>

               <p>I Enter, Sir, into the greateſt and moſt formidable battel that was ever given. To make no doubt hereof, you are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſider the Subject, the Parties, and the Arms. Marriage is the Subject. The buſineſs is to know whether it be uſeful and advantagious for Man, and conducive to his Happineſs. A Queſtion infinitely important, ſince it extends to the deciſion of the Fate of all Mankind. The Parties I have to engage with, are well near all men. There are but few on my ſide, the greateſt part are combin'd againſt this holy Society, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51104:86"/> ſo ſtrong an averſion againſt it, that they cannot bear to hear it commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor forbear to ſay all that's ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Never was Combat more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. My adverſaries are a thouſand to one. <hi>Non unius urbis, ſed univerſi orbis iniquam ſententiam ſuſtinet,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian.</hi> It is not only in one place, in one City, in one Kingdom, that Marriage is exclaim'd againſt, it is throughout all the Univerſe. As to the Arms of thoſe, with whom I have to deal, they are compoſed of leſs Reaſon than Paſſion; and ſavour more of Invective than of Juſtice. But yet they are ſo much the more dangerous, as they are favoured both by the temper of men, and the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things. When a man reflects upon the ſweetneſs of Liberty, the ſad perplexities of Marriage, and all thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil managements which afflict Society, who would not ſay that all our Detracters ought to depend on victory in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute I undertake againſt them?</p>
               <p>But Sir, if <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcourages me, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> on the other ſide, enlivens me. When the occaſion of the battel is juſt, ſays he, one cannot fail of ſucceeding in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51104:86"/> it with advantage, <hi>Si bona fuerit cauſae pugnantis, belli excituus malus eſſe non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erit.</hi> Was there ever a cauſe juſter than that which I defend? It is for the intereſt of all Men, all Families, and all Nations. It is likewiſe for a thing of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whereon depends their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and without which it is impoſſible for them to ſubſiſt. In a word, it is not for a Subject contrary to Law, or Reaſon. It is for a Subject approved of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways recommended by wiſe Men, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by true Reaſon, agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, and conformable to all ſort of right and equity. If a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to himſelf the protection of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any attempt, ſurely he may in this.</p>
               <p>To reply in order to thoſe objections which are made againſt thoſe propoſitions I have eſtabliſh'd, one muſt immediately diſtinguiſh them into theſe three heads, to which in my eſteem they eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Firſt, they object againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and ill Temper of Wives, whereof they make a moſt ſevere cenſure. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſay of Marriage, that it is of it ſelf unworthy of Man, and that nothing leſs
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51104:87"/> agrees with the perfection of his Being. And in the third place, they ſpeak of its Conſequences and Obligations, as of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burden. I hope to make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that in all theſe reſpects the cauſe of my Adverſaries is moſt deplorable, and that there is not only injuſtice, but even madneſs in the deſence of it.</p>
               <p>It is then by the conſideration of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that men begin to be diſguſted at Marriage. What diſobliging things do they not aſſert of them? with what Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and Aſperſions do they tear their reputation, and their vertue? If one ſhould believe them, there would not be a Vice in Morality, but ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them: Nor a Misfortune in the world, whereof they are not the occaſion.</p>
               <p>Inconſtancy, ſay they, is one of the principal characters of a woman.</p>

               <p>'Tis certain then, that what diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es man from Woman is not what is moſt important in him, but what he has in community with her; that is to ſay, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and Vices, which are of the nature of all kinds, of all Sexes, and of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. <hi>Virtus &amp; Malitia determinat nobiles &amp; ignobiles, ſervos &amp; liberos,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches. Now 'tis undeniable, that the man has not more of one, and leſs of others, than the woman. One may even affirm, that he has leſs vertue, and more vice. Firſt, ſince he is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more noble, and enlightned; vice is incomparably more notorious in him, than in the woman, as <hi>Juveual</hi> ſays,

                  </q> All Vices are more conſpicuous and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as the party offending is more or leſs great.</p>
               <p>I remark in the ſecond place, that men are really much more criminal than women, not only becauſe they ought to be much more vertuous, and that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence has one degree of iniquity in them which is not in the women, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they commit much more, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a more egregious manner. This is ſo true, that in the third place, the men are themſelves guilty of the moſt part of the failings of women. If theſe are in any wiſe ill humour'd, the men ought to impute the cauſe thereof to their own proper conduct, which is very often full of Tyranny, Contempt, and Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And if they diſpoſe themſelves ſometimes to vicious exceſſes, it is either becauſe they give them an example, or becauſe they ſolicit them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt application. Poſſibly they are not altogether inſenſible of the darts of love. It may be too, that the tenderneſs of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51104:91"/> their hearts, and the ſweetneſs of their Conſtitution, is often fatal to them in this reſpect. 'Tis well known that they are not Angels, but infirm and ſinful creatures. Nevertheleſs one may judge how diſcree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yes, Sir, make no doubt hereof: It is a manifeſt truth, that the greateſt part of women, either debauch'd, or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, are made ſo by the wickedneſs of Men. If women were allowed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their natural Inclinations, and their charms did not excite againſt them the paſſion of Men; I am perſwaded they would go in the high road to vertue, without turning to the right, or to the left. 'Tis true, if they obſerv'd in us the ſame attractions we obſerve in them, they would perhaps be otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd: But they diſcover none: Or if they do, it muſt be granted that they have more ſtrength of mind, than we, to ſurmount the temptations. What is certain herein is, that they are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51104:91"/> enough upon the Score of Love. Their great infirmity is not in loving, but in deſiring to be beloved, and to ſtudy to appear amiable, in order to procure themſelves hearts. They love to hear men talk things relating to their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But they do not willingly give them an opportunity of talking; yet I confeſs, that they who know how to prevail over this infirmity of the Sex, which makes them covet incenſe and cajoling, at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them to their Laws, and get above their conſtancy. But why ſhould we attribute to them the crime of Men? Why do they employ means to corrupt them? why do they practiſe ſo many ſtratagems to make them forget their duty? Why do they putt things in their mind, which they would never have thought on? why do they abuſe their ſimplicity? Doth it not ill become the men after this to accuſe them of indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to aſperſe their honour? They, who made them faulty in ſpite of themſelves; they, who are the real cauſe of the crimes which they commit in this reſpect: In a word, they who are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more culpable, than the women.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:51104:92"/>
               <p>I affirm as much of their humour. If there are amongſt them ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, and of a difficult acceſs, I cannot abſtain from ſaying that the greateſt part of Husbands make them ſo. How many of them are there, who treat their wives like ſlaves, and imagine to themſelves that they are only born for ſervitude? Hearken, I beſeech you, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint which they make in a Poet touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unhappineſs of their fate: <q>Muſt it not be granted, ſay they, that of all creatures we are the moſt unfortunate? after having purchaſed a Husband dear enough, he muſt be the diſpoſer of our Bodies and Eſtates. It's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that with his perſon we eſpouſe his Inclinations, and undergo that yoak he is pleas'd to impoſe upon us. He acts with impunity what we cannot do without loſs of Fame. If he diſapproves of us, he has the liberty to forſake us. Whatſoever evils we endure with him, we muſt in no wiſe think of a Separation. Divorces are indecent in women. When Domeſtick affairs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed amiſs, he goes to find his conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation abroad. He walks, he diverts himſelf, he frequents good Societies.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51104:92"/> He viſits his friends. He diſperſes by this means all his vexations. But as for us we muſt digeſt them alone. We are unable to ſeek any alleviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but in our ſelves. If we do any thing that's well, no notice is taken of it; but if any diſaſter arrives to the family, we are preſently to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Our pains are ſufficiently known in producing and educating Children, and in the management of all Domeſtick affairs, whilſt our husbands are pleaſing themſelves, and conſider only many times how to rejoyce. How deplorable eſpecially is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when by falſe ſuſpicions againſt our conduct, they become jealous: Or elſe by their courſes they oblige us to prove ſo? Were we as fair and compleat as Angels, they will not ceaſe to be weary of us, and to deſpiſe us, as if we were the moſt deformed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt heat of their Love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd in our boſoms, and they have ſatisfi'd the deſire of their fleſh, they laugh at us, and contemns their promiſes.</q>

               <p>But I alledge at the ſame time, that the men are unjuſt and ungrateful to complain, ſo much as they do, of the ill humour of their wives; to ſay ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſobliging things of them, and to attribute to them all the Severities of Marriage. Beſides, that they ought to hold them very much excuſed in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of their frailty: I affirm that the chiefeſt part of their evil conducts is derived leſs from their fault, than that of their husbands. Generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Wives have much more vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and much leſs pleaſure.</p>
               <p>How many husbands ruin their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51104:93"/> every day by gaming? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ſtarved by their filthy Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? How many of them are undone by miſchievous affairs, and deſtructive corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies, from which their wives might have diverted them, if they had been made acquainted with their deſigns? After all this, can be Wives be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued if Patience eſcapes them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times? if they are not always good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, and it happens that they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to murmur and complain of theſe ill husbands, who by their unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct render their lives inſupportable? O Detractors! aſſert as long as you will that they are cruel, and violent: As for me, I find that they are but little ſo, in regard of the occaſion they have.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, we may juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the women by way of exception. They who condemn them ſo magiſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are men; that is to ſay, they are really parties, and by conſequence very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judges; or to ſay better, they cannot be their Judges. They have an ample right to challenge them: They are too much intereſſed in this proceſs, to have the deciſion referred to them. As pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51104:94"/> as they are againſt the Sex, how ſhould they give an equitable judgment? They only act in paſſion here, which ought to make one preſume the injuſtice of their Sentiments. If Oracles or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes had pronounced a Sentence to the diſadvantage of Women, one ought, I conſeſs, to have ſome deference for their teſtimony: But thoſe are neither Gods, nor Demi-Gods, that ſlander them ſo much. They are very Men, and amongſt them the leaſt ſincere, ſuch as Poets are. That which one of them aſſerted of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, may be alledged of all,

               </p>
               <p>Thus nothing obliges us to beleive them, eſpecially in their Satyrical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations againſt the Sex; for it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in this regard that they have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fables and Romances.</p>
               <p>Let us ſpeak things as they are, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of both ſexes is extream. One may equally apply to both, that thundring Sentence of the Scripture, <hi>All the thoughts of the heart of Man are evil continually.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> But if a

When a man has regard only to the ſweetneſs or the temper of women, and to that gentleneſs of Soul which is ſo natural to them, ſhould he not be perſwaded that they have much fewer evil qualities than men?</p>
               <p>There are ſome notwithſtanding, 'tis true, who are inſupportable; and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories give us an account of ſome, who are capable of frightning all ſingle men, ſuch as the wife of <hi>Job,</hi> and that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> But theſe are exceptions to the general rule, which are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. There would be no juſtice in referring to all the crime of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <q>Cur omnium fit culpa, paucorum Scelus.</q>
               <p>May we not aſſert likewiſe of Men, what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of women, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a thouſand 'twou'd be a hard matter to find one perfect? <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſought after him heretofore with his eyes ſhut, and a Lanthorn in his hand at full Noon, to let us know that it was impoſſible to find him.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:51104:95"/>
               <p>Moreover to apprehend rightly the thought of <hi>Solomon,</hi> it is not ſo diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the Sex, as 'tis imagined. He ſpeaks of a thouſand men with regard to the thouſand Concubines he had. It is as if he had ſaid, if I had a thouſand Men to examine, ſure I ſhould find one very reaſonable. But, O Affliction! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt an equal number of women whom I have choſen, I have not found one perfect, and free from great defects. One may obſerve that he doth not ſpeak of women in general, but of his women in particular. How can any one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to him the belief of not one good woman, he that in ſo many places makes the Encomium of vertuous women; that ſpeaks of them in ſuch honourable terms, and exhorts thoſe men ſo often whom God has favoured with them, to praiſe him inceſſantly for it? As for his own, I conteſt not but he had reaſon to judge of them as he did. It is perhaps the moſt unworthy part of the triumphant Reign of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to have taken ſuch a prodigious multitude of women for his uſe, againſt the expreſs Law of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But to this firſt offence he added ſtill that of taking almoſt all of them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51104:95"/> out of the boſom of Paganiſm; which was no leſs prohibited to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Who makes any doubt of Gods being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incenſed at ſuch a proceeding?</p>
               <p>It may be that to puniſh <hi>Solomon</hi> he purpoſely ſuffered all his women to be of a diſingenious temper. We may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry boldly ſay they were very wicked, ſince they laid ſnares for him even to his Death. <hi>His Women,</hi> ſays the Scripture,<note place="margin">1 Kings 11.4.</note> 
                  <hi>made him turn his heart after other Gods in thè time of his old age.</hi> The impoſing charms of his women, and the inventions of their mind, made him fall into this Misfortune. As he foreſaw that he ſhould have much adoe to get rid of their ambuſhes in this reſpect, he pronounced this Sentence againſt them by anticipation, I never found a good woman. He had reaſon with relation to his own women, but one muſt not extend his thoughts to all women, as if he would have ſaid that there are none good in the world, which never fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, and which is likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry repugnant to the truth of things. The Wives of the ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> an <hi>Abigal,</hi>

               <p>Above all it's very difficult to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Enemies of Women, when they declaim againſt their Chaſtity. Is it not ridiculing God and Men, to cry them down in a particular wherein they are ſo worthy of our Praiſes?

               <p>In my ſecond part, I have ſhewn you perſons ſo poſſeſſed with the love of Women, that they declare themſelves incapable of withſtanding them, They argue for nothing but their neceſſity. Behold now ſome, who are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them. They are for diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with their abſence. They maintain that they are not neceſſary. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety! A man needs only to conſult with himſelf in order to judge that theſe laſt are even more unreaſonable than the firſt. For theſe are at leaſt more ſincere. They ſpeak according to their Sentiments. <hi>Concordat Sermo cum vitâ.</hi> They talk as they live. But thoſe are Impoſtors, who feel not what they ſpeak, but would be taken for perſons much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51104:100"/> above the paſſions, when they are oftentimes enſlaved to them. Their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimultation doth not ceaſe to procure them praiſes. Men, who examine but the outſide, and who only judge of things by appearances, imagine that there are heroical and very extraordinary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in them. Which made <hi>Virgil</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,

               <p>So much is Vertue deſpiſed, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity out of uſe in the world.</p>
               <p>To enter into the bottom of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, I make a propoſition directly contrary to that of my Adveriaries. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, ſay they, is not agreeable to man. It is for his glory not to marry. And I affirm, that Marriage doth agree with Man It is neceſſary for him. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well forbear it. The firſt part of this work very clearly proves the truth of my Propoſition; ſince God has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Marriage; ſince our Saviour has
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51104:100"/> confirm'd it; ſince the Apoſtles have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended it, ſince all Nations of the World have practiſed it, ſince it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to man ſuch great advantages, can one doubt of its agreement with him? and if it is thus excellently good, as I have maintain'd it all along, can one aſſert that it is unworthy of man?</p>
               <p>But let us ſee the Reaſons, upon which it's Adverſaries rely in order to cry it down. They all return to theſe three. Firſt, It is repugnant to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Reaſon over the Senſes and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Secondly, It puts man in the rank of Beaſts. Laſtly, it hinders him from reſembling the Angels. One may reply to all this in few words. What Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick is this! Reaſon is in man what the King is in the State. It ought to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all to it ſelf, and to ſubmit it ſelf to nothing. All the paſſions ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to it, but it ſhould never yield it ſelf to any of them. Therefore Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age doth not agree with Man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man ought not to marry. Can there be more miſerable arguing? One grants the Principle. Reaſon ought to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51104:101"/> govern the paſſions. It ought to be the Miſtreſs. But where have theſe men learnt that Marriage is contrary to its Sovereignty? One may from this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple infer concluſions abſoluetly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to theirs. Reaſon ought to govern the paſſions, by conſequence Marriage is neceſſary for Man. Why? becauſe the Paſſions are much ſtronger in Celibacy, than in Marriage; becauſe Marriage is it ſelf a means to tame the Paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Reaſon governs them, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with more eaſineſs. But ſay they, it ought to triumph over them. It ought to captivate them. Reaſon ought, that I may ſo ſpeak, to ſwallow up the paſſions. This is an evil Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine equally unknown in the School of God, and that of Men. The paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are good in themſelves. They are become criminal only by the pollution of Sin, which has diſorder'd them. Man muſt not be abſolutely diſpoſſeſs'd of them; they are eſſential to him: He cannot even live with integrity, according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> without their aſſiſtance. <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus animi qui non habent, recte non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vunt.</hi> The Indolence of the Stoicks has been at all times condemned. Man nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51104:101"/> can nor ought ever to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paſſion. The ſimple Queſtion is to rectify it, by reducing it into that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Limit, above or beneath which ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue cannot ſubſiſt.</p>

And without that, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, that Paſſion is nothing but the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Beaſt, <hi>Affectio ſine ratione mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus eſt beſtialis.</hi> Now of all things that are able to father his Empire of Reaſon upon the paſſions, I affirm that there is nothing more efficacious than Marriage. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſees nothing fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſpoſe men to wiſdom. By conſequence I have reaſon to ſay, and my adverſaries are in the wrong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51104:102"/> it, that Marriage is very worthy of man, and abſolutely neceſſary for him, even according to their own principle.</p>
               <p>As animal as the action of Marriage is, it is notwithſtanding very conformable to right Reaſon and the Nature of man. One may ſay that man is a mixt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. He is neither all Fleſh, nor all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he is a <hi>compoſitum</hi> of both. He has a Body, he has a Soul. Each of theſe two parts of his Being applies it ſelf to thoſe objects which are ſuitable to it, and agreeable to its Nature. As the Soul is of a coeleſtial and immaterial Original, its ſingle proſpect is, to exalt it ſelf above ſenſible things. But the body, which is terreſtrial, follows its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſtination. All it's motions tend downward. It propoſes to it ſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the enjoyment of Creatures. Man by his Soul has the honour to be the Image of God, and the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels. But indeed by his Body, he enters in ſome ſort in communion of Nature and Society with Beaſts. He doth in this regard what they do. The ſame accidents happen to him. He has the ſame deſires. He is touched with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51104:102"/> the ſame Objects, and has no priviledge over them in this reſpect. Thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heroes, who gave terror and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to the whole world, by the force of their judgments, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Genius, have not fail'd to be ſubject to the concupiſcible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as well as the vileſt of animals. After having equal'd themſelves to the Gods in the ſuperior part of their being, they muſt reſemble beaſts by the inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable Law of the inferior part. I confeſs that it is very mortifying, for the King of Animals not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd herein from his Subjects, and to encreaſe after the ſame manner and by the ſame ways, as they. But be not ſurprized at it. This was neceſſary for the deſign of their common Creator. He has of a ſudden and without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Sex form'd that innumerable multitude of Spirits, which compoſe the Hierarchy of Angels and Devils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being incorruptible intelligences they were by conſequence incapable of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But God having been pleaſed to make all human-kind of one blood, as the Apoſtle ſays, and by way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, it was neceſſary to give to Man,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51104:103"/> an Organized body. It was neceſſaty to render him capable of multiplying. It was expedient for him to make two Sexes. In a word, it was convenient to give them that natural deſire of uniting together, which makes the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kind, but which is never law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful without Marriage. Can one aſſert after this, that it is unworthy of man with relation to this Union of Sexes? As deſpicable as it is in it ſelf, is it not ſufficient that it is the deſign of Nature, and the very order of God, who has commanded us to encreaſe and multiply, in order to raſe all the Scandal, which the moſt ſcrupulous perſons might receive from thence? As I have already ſaid, it is as conformable to reaſon, as agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the nature of man. Reaſon it ſelf diſpoſes men to it. In general it approves of all that is deſign'd by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. And in particular it ſuffers man to practiſe all that tends to the good and preſervation of his being. Its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is not to diſpoſſeſs him of a deſire ſo eſſential to him as that is, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reduce it to its juſt meaſure, and to bring it back to lawful uſe. Thus we may affirm, that this Union is no
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51104:103"/> leſs neceſſary to the world, than drinking and eating, and all other animal functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Let us ſay then by conſequence- that it contains nothing unworthy of us, provided that Reaſon conducts the paſſion to it, and that the paſſion is not without reaſon therein. In all this we ſhall affirm what is true.</p>
               <p>But ſay they, the State of a Batchellor makes us reſemble Angels and Saints. It is by conſequence in man an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perfection. I deny, that a Celibacy purely corporeal is a perfection, and that it likens us to Angels and Saints: Since marriage is of the order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the inſtitution of God, and the duty of man, purſuant to the proofs I have brought, how ſhould a ſingle ſtate which is directly oppoſite to it, be of it ſelf a vertue? It is exactly with Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy, as with a Faſt. What is more indifferent, than to eat and drink? Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is only conſiderable becauſe the Church recommends the practice of it, and may contribute much to the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Vices, and the encreaſe of their Vertues: But no body ever ſaid that it was a Vertue in it ſelf. They,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51104:104"/> who remain in a ſingle ſtate with that wiſdom preſcribed by the Goſpel, are doubtleſs worthy of our praiſes; not with relation to Celibacy it ſelf; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may make them fitter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties of Piety. If Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were a vertue, then Marriage muſt be a crime. It is indeed what the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainiſts</hi> and other Hereticks formerly taught; But St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts this Doctrine amongſt thoſe of the Devils: And it is a long time ſince the Church thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck it with its Anathema's. As for thoſe happy Virgins of the <hi>Revelations</hi> who follow the Lamb every where, and who were never defil'd with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what follows, and what precedes, moſt clearly juſtifies; that one muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that to a ſence purely ſpiritual and metaphorical. 'Tis evident, and the Text ſays it, that the holy Spirit means by theſe Virgins the 144000 mark'd out, who in the ſame Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd faithful to the Lamb,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.</note> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Idolatries and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of thoſe Myſtical women, who were to make all the Earth drunk with the wine of their whoredoms, but having
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51104:104"/> only followed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Word, and in the practice of the Precepts of his Goſpel. This therefore makes neither for Celibacy nor againſt Marriage. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogſt thoſe Virgins there might be as many married, as ſingle. All the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Celibacy over Marriage, is, that they who make a good uſe of it, may find more eaſineſs to ſerve God, and avoid divers inconveniencies to which married perſons are ſubject. But beſides that each State has its own difficulty, as I have made appear, how much hazard doth a man run in that of Celibacy by the almoſt inſuperable difficulty of fulfilling all its duties? who knows not what St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſays of the Empire of our bodies over our Souls; <hi>Corpus trahit animam in regionem ſuam?</hi> Who is ignorant with what rapidity the paſſions draw us along? who is not ſenſible that it is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to have a purity of body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cleanneſs of Soul? who knows not, in a word, to ſpeak with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that an humble Marriage is of much more value, than a proud Virginity? <hi>Melius eſt humile conjugium, quàm ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Virginitas</hi>

               <p>'Tis granted, that Marriage puts men under engagements, which come very near to ſervitude. But, Sir, you muſt not think that there is no ſervitude, but what is ſcandalous, and contrary to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51104:106"/> Don't you know, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that to ſerve God is to reign It the ſame with Marriage in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. It is a ſervitude, I confeſs; but it is a volutary one. It gives a right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Sovereignty. It is rewarded with a thouſand charms, which are not to be found in the liberty of a ſingle life. What do you apprehend this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be? It is for the moſt part no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a pure licentiouſneſs. Doth it not appear how the greateſt part of Batchelors live? They are not confined to one woman, but are concatenated by a thouſand criminal paſſions. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philoſopher conceiv'd nothing to be more infamous, than the ſervitude of a Voluptuous Perſon. <hi>Nulla ſervitus tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pior eſt quam voluptaria.</hi> Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons imagine themſelves to be free, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not ſubject to the Law of Marriage. But doth not the ſame thing happen to them exactly, which fell out to thoſe Fools, whom <hi>Horace</hi> ſpeaks of,
<q>
                     <hi>Dum vita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt ſtulti vitia, in contraria currant.</hi>

               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:51104:106"/>
               <p>They think to avoid one Slavery, and fall into another which is worſe. They fly from that of Marriage which is noble, and conformable to the Nature of Man, and take up that of Vices, which diſhonours them, and is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Grace of our Saviour. For in Fine, one muſt not be deceived. As a good man is free, altho' he ſerves, ſo a man that's free, who indulges his luſts, is a real ſlave. Theſe are two things equally certain. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> eſtabliſhes the one, <hi>Bonus, etiam ſi ſerviat, liber eſt,</hi> ſays he: and <hi>Cicero</hi> eſtabliſhes the other in theſe words, <hi>Liber eſt exiſtimandus, qui nulli turpitudini ſervit.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more virtuous a man is, the more he is free, it neceſſarily follows that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a leſs Servitude than Celibacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who are married have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more vertue than ſingle perſons. Add, Sir, that as thorny as this ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is, one doth not ceaſe to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. One of the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities one finds in it, is, even the fear of its not continuing long enough. A husband and a wiſe, that love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot reflect without trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their future ſeparation. They had
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51104:107"/> rather dy, than live apart. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of the Roman Orator, one ſhould not call the yoak of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage incommodious or tireſom, ſince one bears it with an eaſineſs. <hi>Onus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>non eſt appellandum, quod cum laetitiâ fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras ac voluptate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> being ask'd which was beſt, Marriage, or a ſingle Life, made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; Marry, or marry not, thou ſhalt ever repent. It's true, that there are in both conditions ſubjects of vexations and diſpleaſures. I even confeſs that one may meet with much more in that of Marriage, than in that of Celibacy. But in recompence, the ſatisfactions a man taſts in Marriage, are much more pure and ſenſible, which I have made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the firſt parts of this work. The peace which ſucceeds a long and cruel war, is ſo much the more ſweet and reliſhing: And after the experience of rough tempeſts, one finds the Calm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better. The repoſe of Celiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is a repoſe of ſoftneſs, ſecurity and ſelf love: By conſequence it is a fatal, and deceitful repoſe. There is none real or agreeable, ſays <hi>Seneca,</hi> but that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51104:107"/> which comes from reaſon. <hi>Nulla pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida quies eſt, niſi quam ratio compoſuit.</hi> The trouble of Marriage, on the other ſide, is a trouble of ſafety, magnanimity, and courage. <hi>Aſpera vita, ſed ſalubris.</hi> It is of that one may truly ſay, <hi>Sic itur ad aſtra.</hi> It is the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; very difficult, 'tis true: But it is what Vertue ſeeks for.</p>
               <q>Difficile eſt, fateor,<note place="margin">Ovid. de Ponto.</note> ſed tendit in ardua virtus.</q>
               <p>It degenerates into Vice, when it has no adverſary to encounter. But I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is no condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vertues have a more lawful and advantagious exerciſe than Marriage. Admit that a perſon ſhould not taſt thoſe real pleaſures I have ſpoken of, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe vexations he may meet with, yet he ought not to deſiſt inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf under it's diſcipline; ſince it is ſo proper to illuſtrate it's vertues, and to direct him to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the difficulties of Marriage, I allow the Education and Eſtabliſhment of Children to be one of the chief. It's
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51104:108"/> neceſſary for that end to obſerve ſuch cares, which very often renders life ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly uneaſy. But after all, ſince man is born for trouble, and that he is ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal. <hi>Onerificum,</hi> as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> elegant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls him, can he undertake a more lawfull one, or for a nobler ſubject? That Maxim of <hi>Seneca,</hi> is here natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally applied, <hi>Non eſt viri timere ſudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem?</hi> Is it humane to fear the fatigue of making men? Is it the part of a man to continue in Celibacy, in order to avoid the real occupations of man? or in a word, to fly from Marriage through the fear of diſcharging one of the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humanity, and of anſwering the firſt end of Nature?</p>
               <p>I have yet two things to reply to the enemies of Marriage, upon the ſubject of children: One is, that ſloth and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are the moſt ſhameful things to man in the world: And the other is, that nothing is more capable of diſpoſing him to it, than the want of Children. Theſe two propoſitions are of a ſenſible truth. As to the firſt, An Apoſtle tells us in expreſs terms, that he who doth not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that is, remains without action, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51104:108"/> himſelf to no trouble, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to eat. In effect, it has been very properly ſaid, <hi>Nihil agendo homines ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè agere diſcunt.</hi> By doing nothing one learns to do what's ill. Idleneſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts bodies, as want of motion infects Rivers.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Oftentimes this Vice has been even fatal to great Princes, and the happieſt Common-wealths.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> were deſtroyed hereby. One cannot therefore too ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly ſhun it. I ſay in the ſecond place, that nothing can be imagined more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual againſt it, than a Marriage fruitful in Children; when a man is alone, and has nothing to think of but himſelf, he is ſcarce moved for what's to come.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51104:109"/> He flies from labour, and applies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the diverſions of a licentious life. But when God has given you Heirs to ſucceed you in your Fortnnes, you muſt neceſſarily mind ſomewhat elſe. You muſt conſider them, as well as your ſelf. Our Children are our firſt Creditors. They are born ſuch. We owe to them naturally Subſiſtence and Education. We muſt labour all our lives to acquit our ſelves of that debt. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſays that riches are a pain to thoſe who have no children, <hi>Quibus deficit ſoboles ſua poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia poena eſt.</hi> But I add, that poverty is doubly one to thoſe who want them. Poor men have occaſion for them to be a continual motive to them to exerciſe and practiſe all honeſt means towards the delivering them out of their miſeries. It is perhaps for this reaſon that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are uſually termed their Riches. Thus Children are neceſſary to all the world, and to deprive ones ſelf of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage through the fear of having them, is to ſhut ones Ears againſt the voice of Nature, and that of Providence.</p>
               <p>There remains nothing more but to anſwer the objection, which is made
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51104:109"/> concerning the ill humour of Wives, and domeſtick Quarrels. Without diſpute this is what's moſt uneaſy in marriage. When once diviſion is introduced, and one comes to diſputes, thorns ariſe on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>quod praeſtare ipſe non poſſis.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is the humour of the men. They would have women to be without any ſort of defect. They maintain, they ſhould be as perfect as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.

               <p>What injuſtice is here! can the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants practiſe it themſelves? Is it not a thing above humanity? Since then we cannot be without defects, we ought to love one another with them. The
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51104:110"/> man ſhould charitably bear with thoſe of the woman, and the woman thoſe of the man. Every one has his own. You will find them every where. If you do not ſuffer thoſe of a wife, you will have thoſe of a Friend, thoſe of a Domeſtick, thoſe of all the world to bear; and ſhould you be delivered from them, you would have ſtill your own to ſuffer, which would be ſo much the more inſupportable, in that having none but them to think of, they will appear to you infinitely more worthy of your horrour. What the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts remark, that the ſame ſoil which produces Poiſons, likewiſe brings forth remedies for them, may be very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the wife. If ſhe be to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band a cauſe of diſquiet, ſhe is likewiſe to him one of joy. If ſhe afflicts him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſhe comforts him much oftner. If ſhe diſpleaſes you in one kind, how agreeable doth ſhe appear to you in a hundred others? in reſpect of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences one has with her, I confeſs that nothing is more affecting at the time, and that there never was a fruit of ſo unreliſhing a taſt. But happily they do not continue long. <hi>Faciles conjugum ſunt reconciliationes.</hi> One night, ſays the

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51104:112"/> in the buſineſs of Marriage. All that I have ſaid hitherto neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes one well done, and well conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. To this is referrable all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which I have declared to be found in a conjugal union. As much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Marriage as its adverſaries are, they voluntrily grant, that it is a Society which may be agreeable, if the parties were always at peace, and in caſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had occaſion to complain of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That which cauſes their miſtake, is the prepoſſeſſion they are in, that it is impoſſible to find ſuch a circumſtance. If then it can be made appear that ſuch a thing may be, and that ſuch Precepts are given which may be of force to perſwade them, that in the practice of them it is eaſy to attain to this happy Marriage, they muſt confeſs themſelves to be overcome. I hope, Sir, this part of my Treatiſe will have this ſucceſs both for them, and for you. I hope it will perfectly convince you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more advantagious for man, than a good Marriage. What one ought to do in order to marry, and what one ought to do in Marriage, are the two
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51104:112"/> points, which I propoſe to explain, in order to ſatisfy my Engagement, and your Expectation.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that an honeſt man ſhould do, after he is determined for Marriage, is to requeſt of God a wife according to his mind. Remember, Sir, that Providence is concerned in every thing, and that there is nothing here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but it diffuſes its influences upon. As corrupted as the <hi>Pagan</hi> Theology was, yet the <hi>ſine Deo nihil feliciter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit,</hi> was one of its Maxims. What elſe was that Fortune to which even <hi>Cicero</hi> ſubjects all Events, and which he regards as the Sovereign Empreſs of the world, <hi>Fortuna Domina rerum,</hi> but that particular conduct of God towards all creatures, which we adore under the name of Providence?</p>
               <p>After having asked of God a wife according to his mind, he ought under the protection of Providence to ſeek one after his own. This, Sir, imports two things; the one is, that ſhe be pleaſing to his Eyes: And the other, that ſhe

All men do not reſpect women with the ſame eye, nor in the ſame manner. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more various, than the Judgment they make of them.

               <p>It is a thing, 'tis true, wherein one is often deceiv'd, by reaſon of that Art of fiction which is ſo natural to the Sex. It is an ordinary ſaying, That there never was a wicked Maid, becauſe they know how to appear good, when they are not ſo. St. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> remarks, that Horſes and other Beaſts are always bought upon trial; but that it is not ſo with a Wife. <hi>Sola uxor non oſtenditur ne antè diſpliceat quam ducatur.</hi> If ſhe be violent, haſty, proud, infirm, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever vice ſhe has, we never find it till the Nuptials are over. He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate hereby, that one runs a great hazard in Marrying; and I deny it not. But without having recourſe either to that proof of ſix Months, practis'd in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi> by certain people of the Earth before Marriage; or to the Letter of divorce amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> which are things directly contrary to the purity of Chriſtianity, it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conduct ones ſelf in this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair with ſome kind of aſſurance, by the means of ſeveral precepts of wiſdom.</p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:51104:115"/>
               <p>That which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives, is to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a young Wife, and one that is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, in order to the more eaſie forming of her into good Manners. He affords this reaſon elſewhere: <hi>Juvenes non ſunt maligni moris, ſed facilis, propterea quod nondum viderunt nequitias.</hi> It is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that young Women are much more eaſie to modify than others. As they have not yet contracted any evil habits, you may without difficulty inſpire them with good ones. Being ſcarce acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with evil, they may ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuck in the good.</p>
               <q>Dum faciles animi juvenum,<note place="margin">Virg. 3. Georg.</note> dum mobilis aetas.</q>
               <p>In effect, it is eaſie to imprint upon a heart the Maxims of Vertue, when it is void of the Maxims of Vice. It were better for a Wife to be wanting in ſome of the qualities neceſſary for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Houſe, than to have thoſe which are capable of making a Husband unhappy. The one may be obtained with Years, but Years do but fortify the others.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:51104:116"/>
               <p>If this advice be good, that of <hi>Heſiod</hi> is no leſs. He would have the perſon who is to Marry, take a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Acquain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>I don't know any precept, Sir, more important for practice than this. Why do Marriages ordinarily ſucceed ſo ill? It is becauſe the parties Marry without knowing one another, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing whether one be the make of the other. One being inchanted with a beauty, which perhaps he never ſaw but once, is ſo tranſported with his love, that he can only ſigh, and live for her, without examining whether ſhe has beſides what a Woman ought to have in order to live contented with her, and without conſidering any thing elſe but to ſatisfy his fooliſh Paſſion, he Marries her. The other through a deſire of being Rich, will moſt willingly accept of ſuch a Perſon who is the worſt ſhap'd, and the leaſt reaſonable in the World, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he may have wherewith to make his Fortune. The greateſt part of Marriages are made either by the interpoſition of another, or for reaſons of wordly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51104:116"/> One regards the out-ſide, without a thought of what relates to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part. A man examines the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Woman, and is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with her Manners. This without diſpute is the reaſon why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people are unhappy in the choice they make. The principal thing then is, to ſtudy well the humour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a Woman, in order to know if ſhe has a conformity with yours, and if you could live peaceably together. For this end you muſt not go to ſeek her in a Country remote from you; you muſt, as far as in you lies, take her as it were at your door. It will be a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter if you ſee her often, and have a little regard to her deportments, not to diſcover at length all that ſhe is.</p>
               <p>Behold, Sir, a third precept, which is yet more aſſured than the other two. Marry a young Lady of good exſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and who belongs to People of an irreproachable Life. This is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Maxim, whoſe truth is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, <hi>viz.</hi> That Children almoſt always reſemble thoſe from whom they deriv'd their being.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:51104:117"/>
               <p>I know there are thoſe who degenerate from the vertue of their Anceſtors; but to ſpeak generally, one may ſay, without danger of being decived, Like Father, like Son; like Mother, like Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Saepe patris mores imitatur filius infans.</hi>
               </q>
               <q>The boy oft imitates the Fathers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</q>

               </q>
               <q>And the Daughter grenerally treads in her Mothers footſteps.</q>
               <p>It is the Example they continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves. But they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more inclined to imitate them in evil, than in good. For, as <hi>Juvenal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us,
<q>

               </p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:51104:117"/>
               <p>There is nothing that more corrupts our Manners, than Domeſtick ill Examples. Doubtleſs then it would be a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, for an honeſt man to Marry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Family of a bad reputation, and to take the Daughter of a Mother who is either immodeſt, or ſullied with ſome ſcandalous Vice. On the other ſide, one may preſuppoſe much prudence and good diſpoſitions in a damoſel of good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and who was educated by a Vertuous Mother. Not but that excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be allowed: The moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule is not excuſed from them. But it may be taken for granted, that this is one of the moſt certain, and that few of thoſe who ſhall practiſe it, will find it unſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>I add, Sir, this Precept to the reſt. In Marrying, affect as much as in you lies an Equality of condition and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. If you take a Wife of a Family more exalted than yours, ſhe will not fail to boaſt of it at your expence, you ſhall be ſufficiently told of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her Original, and the Baſeneſs of your own. Beſides, the certainty of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to her ſelf the right of comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

<q>O ter infelix qui exiſtens pauper ducit uxorem!</q>
               </p>
               <p>But Sir, be perſwaded, that Vertue is of infinite more worth without Riches, than Riches without Vertue; they ought never to be the end of Marriage: The ſame Author who ſpeaks of Poverty in ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious a manner, with relation to Marriage, doth not fail to acknowledge that Merit ought to be preferred to Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
<q>Morem praeponere pecuniis ducturum uxorem oportet.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yes without doubt, the beſt porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Wife can bring to a Husband, is the wiſdom of her and her Fathers.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:51104:119"/>
               <p>Nothing but this is capable of rendring him happy in the poſſeſſion of a Wife. If you take a Wife upon account of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, you may aſſure your ſelf that you will never repent of it. She will inceſſantly draw down upon you the bleſſings of Heaven, and you will find your ſelf much happier with ſuch a wife, even in the midſt of indigence, than you would be in the greateſt proſperity with a wife of Gold, but without this precious Vertue. He who enjoys ſuch a one, ſays <hi>Cicero,</hi> has all that is neceſſary to live happily. <hi>In quo virtus ſit eì nihil deeſſe ad beatè vivendum puto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have but one precept more to give you upon this ſubject. Be careful not to marry one againſt her will, who will always have a contempt of you. I will pronounce it boldly, nothing is more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital than that in the deſign of mrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age There are but very few of this kind, which have not very fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.

               <q>A wife that is marry'd to a man againſt her will, is an Enemy.</q>
               <p>It is the moſt unhappy thing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be guilty of, to commit violence upon her inclination, and to conſtrain her to eſpouſe a man whom ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love. You will never make her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her reſentments. This marriage will occaſion to you all the thorns and diſpleaſures, which <hi>Juvenal</hi> repreſents in theſe Verſes:

               <p>Never have any thoughts for marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, Sir, unleſs you reſolve to practiſe all theſe precepts.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:51104:121"/> all conſiſt in the practice of two ſorts of Duties, towards two ſorts of Perſons. The one regard the wife, and the others refer to the Children. The good or evil of marriage proceed alone from theſe two parts.

This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the matter which remains to be treated of in order to fullfil the deſign of this work, very important. It is, Sir, ſo much the more, in that by acquitting your ſelf of the duties whereof I ſhall diſcourſe, you will make your wife be a bleſſed Fountain to you at all times, to ſpeak with <hi>Solomon.</hi> All the world is not happy enough to meet with this advantage: The Precautions, which one takes for this end, are, I confeſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unprofitable: But it is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, that a wife, who by nature is not very reaſonable, ſhall become ſo if the Husband rules himſelf with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51104:122"/> to her according to my Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>I begin them, by declaring to you, that if you would be happy in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, you muſt neceſſarily be loved of your wife. You cannot be beloved of her, if you do not love her. Therefore be ſure to love her. This is the firſt Leſſon a Husband ought to learn. It comes from St. <hi>Paul: Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25.28.</note> ſays he, <hi>love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church,</hi> &amp;c. Would you know the reaſon? <q>Husbands ought <hi>to love their Wives as their own Bodies;</hi> He that loves his wife, loves himſelf. <hi>No</hi> body <hi>ever hated his own Fleſh.</hi>
                  </q> By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Husband ought to love his Wife, for his wife is his own fleſh. They are no more two, but one fleſh. What is more reaſonable than this duty? what ought to be more precious to us, than our ſelves? We ought then in the firſt place to love our wives by a motive of ſelf-love, ſince we cannot love our ſelves, but we muſt love them, being, that I may ſo ſpeak, a part of our own ſubſtance:

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:51104:122"/> What a prodigious thing would it be to ſee a man declare himſelf an enemy to himſelf, and to have an averſion for his own perſon? St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, that it was never ſeen, and inſinuates to us that it is a thing not to be ſeen in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature. It is notwithſtanding what arrives to all thoſe who love not their wives.</p>
               <p>A man ought in the ſecond place to love his wife by a Motive either of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Intereſt, or pure acknowldgment. Either ſhe loves you, or ſhe doth not love you. If ſhe loves you, you cannot without ingratitude forbear to love her. On the other ſide if ſhe loves you not, you ought to love her, to the end that ſhe may be won to love you. This Maxim of <hi>Seneca</hi> is of abſolute neceſſity in Marriage: <hi>Si vis amari, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> Love is gain'd only by Love. It is not to be obtain'd by Force or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. <hi>Amor extorqueri non poteſt,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca.</hi> Naturally we love thoſe who love us.

               <p>After this Rule I cannot give you a better, than to afford your ſelf for an Example to your wife: Of all the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the Chriſtian Morality, the moſt equitable and moſt certain is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, to do to others what we would have done to our ſelves.

                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:51104:124"/> in his Conduct? Marriage is a Bridle, that keeps men within the bounds of ſanctity, and Motive to eſchew Vices. Is there a ſingle man, who doth not deſire to be wife, and to be able to deſerve the Praiſes of a good man? and is not this the true way that directs to it?</p>
               <p>But, Sir, amongſt the Vertues whoſe Example you owe to a wife, you muſt above all things ſtudy to inſpire her with that of devotion. One cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what Good a devout Wife is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing a Husband, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he may receive from thence. Whether he be ſick or well, rich or poor: In proſperity, or in miſery; in joy, or ſorrow: He will always find in her an aſſiſtance proportioned to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſomewhere ſays, that Piety is good for every thing. I ſay as much of a devout Wife. Nothing is more Angelical, nothing more excellent. Happy, and thrice happy, may one call that man, to whom Heaven has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a preſent.</p>
               <p>The exterior Cauſe of Devotion is the frequent Reading Divine Books,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51104:125"/> and the works of Piety of Eccleſiaſtical Authors. To this, Sir, you ought to turn the genius of your Wife, as much as in you lies. If once ſhe takes a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure herein, 'tis almoſt infallible that ſhe will have a regard to her Salvation, a contempt for the World, and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for Sin, which are the eſſential Characters of true devotion. But if this kind of reading be infinitely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſpoſe a Wife to wiſdom, that of Romances and Comedies is not leſs effectual to turn her inclination from it. Whatſoever may be ſaid in favour of theſe eloquent fictions, I can aſſure you that nothing is fitter to corrupt the heart and to inflame it with the love of Creatures. If Fathers and Mothers were ſenſible of the pernicious impreſſions, which theſe forts of books are capable of giving their Daughters, they would undoubtedly employ all their cares to conceal the very Names from them. Take off your Wife therefore from the humour of reading ſuch books. It is a School wherein ſhe will never fail to learn what will render you unhappy, they will make her wanton, vain, ridiculous, inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable. When ſhe comes to compare
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51104:125"/> you with thoſe imaginary <hi>Heroes</hi> dreſſed in Romances after the manner of the Gods, ſhe will be apt to eſteem you no longer, you will almoſt neceſſarily become the Object of her contempt. On the other ſide, be careful to put into her hands the Prophets and Apoſtles: Let this be her ordinary Employment. Let her make thereof the whole matter of her diverſion. O Holy and Divine School, where one learns to become like God himſelf, and to practiſe the Duties of an Angelical perfection:</p>
               <p>Prayer is both the principal act of Devotion, and the moſt aſſured means to obtain Grace. Practiſe it, Sir, and make your Wife practiſe the ſame with exactneſs. Accuſtom your ſelf to pray often to God with her in the midſt of your Family: Humble your ſelves often together before that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Majeſty, from whom you expect all your good things, and all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Let him hear ſeveral times in a day the voice of your heart with that of your mouth. Repreſent to him all your wants, and make appear in your Prayers a holy ardour, that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51104:126"/> the zeal of your Wife. Were ſhe the moſt unreaſonable of Women, ſhe would become the Sweeteſt and moſt compliant, if you would confine your ſelf, as you ought, to the practice of this Duty. It is extreamly neglected now a days in the moſt part of Chriſtian Families, to their ſhame be it ſpoken, and we have but too much reaſon to ſay with the Poet,
<q>

               </p>
               <p>Above all, Sir, a man ought to live in a good underſtanding with his wife, and to agree well together in relation to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick affairs. In the little ſtate of a Family, as well as in the great State of the Republick, concord is abſolately ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its ſubſiſtence. By that, ſays <hi>Saluſt,</hi> the leaſt things become great, and without it the greateſt are of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>Concordiâres parvae creſcunt. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiâ maximae dilabuntur.</hi> When a Husband and Wife miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another,<note place="margin">Sal. in Jug.</note> and each fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his own caprice or deſign, all is loſt, the family falls of courſe. This
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:51104:126"/> is called in our Proverbial Language to <hi>Light a Candle at both Ends.</hi> If you con't inſtruct your Wife in your affairs, and manage all things without her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, ſhe will eaſily be perſwaded of one of theſe two things. Either ſhe will believe that you are Rich, when perhaps you are poor: Or ſhe will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that you are poor, when it may be you are Rich. This double error will make her fall into a double exceſs. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe will become Prodigal, and be at a hundred ſorts of vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expences: Or ſhe will become co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and ſpare even what's neceſſary. Both will be equally inconvenient for you. To avoid which, impoſe upon your ſelf this Law of accounting to her your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. Let her know from time to time the terms you are in with Fortune. Undertake nothing of moment without her advice. It is both juſt and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for you to do ſo. For what end have the Laws and cuſtoms eſtabliſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods between Husbands and Wives, but to inform us, that as both ought to contribute their utmoſt cares to make it good, ſo it is juſt that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands who are maſters thereof, ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51104:127"/> their Wives of the good or evil, the loſs or the advantage of it. Is it not a thing which regards them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon? would it be reaſonable for them to be always ignorant of their own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? and can they beat with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Husbands, whole ſingle aim is to hold them perpetually in ignorance, to deceive them, and to conceal all things from them? it is not to be admired at, if they find themſelves miſtaken, and if their wives practiſe on their ſide ſuch methods as diſpleaſe them. Let a wiſe be never ſo patient and eaſy, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bear for ever with a Husband, who uſes her like a <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Moor,</hi> and not as his wife, but as his Servant. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, that it was for his advantage to treat her otherwiſe, and to diſcover to her the whole bottom of his heart and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>airs. In effect, beſides that this will pleaſe her, and that ſhe will find her ſelf obliged to a Husband that has ſo much complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for her, ſhe will learn by this means to regulate her expences, and to manage her ſelf after a manner proportion'd to the condition of the family. What is more important, and deſerves more applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the practice of this Precept?</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:51104:127"/>
               <p>But this is enough concerning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods Husbands ought to practiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their wives, in order to live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their Society. Now let us ſee in a few words, to the end we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this work, to what this deſign en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them with relation to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This, Sir, is one of the Springs, from whence as I have ſaid, proceeds to married perſons all their happineſs, or all their Misfortune. In effect, when a man has Children, that ſeem to be well born, and in whom appear the marks of a true wiſdom, as miſerable as he is, and how great ſoever their number is, he finds therein the motives of a very ſweet conſolation. On the other ſide, what is more afflicting than to have ſuch as are vicious, and of unwiſe conduct? <hi>Solomon</hi> aſſures us of both; <hi>Filius ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens,</hi> ſays he, <hi>laetificat Patrem. Filius ſtul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus dolor eſt Patris.</hi> A wiſe Son rejoices the Father, the fooliſh Son is the grief of the Father.</p>
               <p>From thence you may judge of what importance education is, and how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary it is to give Children a good one. <hi>Educatio &amp; diſciplina mores facit,</hi> ſays <hi>Seneca. Plutarch</hi> regards it as a new birth,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51104:128"/> which we take in the boſom of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> puts thoſe Maſters, who have taught us the art of living well in the rank of thoſe to whom we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquit our ſelves of the obligation, <hi>Magiſtris, Diis, &amp; Parentibus non poteſt reddi aequivalens.</hi> They are all equally reaſonable. For if it be true, that <hi>Praemium virtutis eſt bona inſtitutio,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, both that Education is whats ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable for men, and that we are no leſs obliged to our fathers for having given us a good one, than for our life it ſelf; and that we can never ſhew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment enough. 'Tis a great deal, I confeſs, to have received a being, but I dare affirm that it is infinitely more to have received a good one. Birth gives us one common with beaſts: But 'tis education that preſents us with the other, and which renders us in ſome kind, like to the Angels.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, if a good Education be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry important with relation to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is no leſs in regard of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If it be to the one a principle of wiſdom, it is one of good fortune to the others. As I have ſaid, a Father cannot
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51104:128"/> be happy, if his Children be unwiſe. The one is a neceſſary ſtep to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. From whence appears the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obligation of a Father to ſacrifice with pleaſure his cares and his ſubſtance for the inſtruction of his Children, and the forming of them to good manners. When he has the advantage of ſucceeding herein, he taſts in Marriage that felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I have ſpoken of in my firſt part: that is to ſay, what is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and delightful in the World.</p>
               <p>All Fathers, 'tis true, are not in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to advance their Children to Sciences, nor capable of teaching them themſelves. I confeſs, this is a misfortune for both. I know very well that Sciences are not abſolutely neceſſary to bring men to the habits of wiſdom. They may be obtained, I grant, without them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it muſt be agreed on, that they may be of great uſe towards it, and that Philoſopher, doubtleſs, had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to place in the number of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subjects he had to thank God for, that he was a Philoſopher. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there is much leſs corruption amongſt the Learned, than amongſt others. Their
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51104:129"/> vice is leſs in the heart, than in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and it conſiſts more in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than in action. As imperfect as knowing men are, they always make appear in their conduct ſome degrees of honeſty, which diſtinguiſh them to advantage. If knowledge has corrupted men, it has been by accident, after the ſame manner that the Sun infects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sinks and Carcaſſes. It has been often abuſed, I confeſs, but in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom nothing is beter of it ſelf. Would to God, ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> that all theſe People were Prophets! There is not a Father but ought to make the ſame wiſh for his Children, to deſire they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Learned, and to uſe his laſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to obtain them this advantage, as the greateſt of all goods.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, Sir, that to ſucceed well in the Education of Children, one muſt go in the midſt of two oppoſite extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and preſerve a juſt temper between ſeverity and indulgence. Love and Fear ought to divide the whole chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Education on the childrens ſide, as correction and inſtruction on the fathers. If you give them too large a freedom,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51104:129"/> they will deſpiſe you: If you allow them none they will hate you. If you have too much indulgence for them, they will become licentious: If you are too auſtere, they will be too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. In a word, if you make appear too much ſweetneſs in your conduct, theirs will be extreamly looſe. On the other ſide, if you never look upon them but with an angry eye, you make them vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, extravagant, and inſenſible of all your Exhortations. You ſee then how neceſſary it is to joyn theſe two things together in paternal diſcipline. A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought in ſome meaſure to imitate God herein, of whom the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays, <hi>That in the midſt of his chaſtiſements he always thinks of Mercy.</hi> The Father, 'tis true, is the ſovereign Magiſtrate of his Family, and as ſuch he ought to try his children, and puniſh them when he finds them guilty. But if he condemns them as a Judge, he ought to chaſtiſe them as a Father, that is to ſay, with huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and emotions of Love.</p>
